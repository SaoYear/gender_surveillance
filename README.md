# Gender_surveillance
This project connects yolov3 with a gender classification CNN network. The accuracy of CNN reached 86% in gender classification task, and the whole system is able to run in real time.

# Pedestrian detection
This part includes yolov3 based on keras and HOG+SVM method.
For yolov3, the code can be find [here](https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3). 
I only uploaded a modified code with additional function to connect the downstream gender classification task: **yolo.py**.

# Gender classification
This part includes a plain CNN method and a ResNet structure as well as their ensemble models.
